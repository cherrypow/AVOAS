Black clouds are swallowed by the sounds of howls and drowning in webs the rain and thunder flood the sky. A gnashing of wind on the trees, skeins of light flicker psychosis. Packs of dogs roam as if in echoes of spirit, blood dripping from their jaws. They slink with wet coats, shivering through the storm. You hide beneath a tree. You hide beneath a tree. Deep somewhere, somewhere not here or there is a birthing of a picture. She comes out of a lake vibrating in the rain, her body is pale and burning and beating is her heart and her eyes are black and alien thoughts move like storms behind them. She is dripping and steaming and flickering in light. Tell them she says do not call me, do not speak. A crack of lightning calls from out of her throat and whelms you, she falls to her knees and takes the knife against her neck and the hot blood like perfume for the dogs to follow and she is burning and you can't forget her. Close to her face, she whispers, paint me, before it's all over. Before everything ends, the thing you want you can't have. Then the rain, dripping down lampposts, the sound with the window open. The folding breaks of thunder like sonorous shores aspiring to still themselves to silence. The sky closed, covered in her dark hair, her hair falling in lobes against his face. Closing his eyes. 

Remember me? Can't you see me through the storm? Lost colours. My eyes are fireblue. My body is fresh and hot as campfire. Remember me watching you?

Speak, Memory: Hot tails of fireworks scaling into the dark sky. In a park. With the carousels and candy apples. You bit your tongue and tasted the salt of blood just before the lobes of light went seething up and lit her face, purple and red streams of light on her pale eyes. And then into the woods she took you. Falling onto the grass and her legs covered in a snot and her eyes staring up into you and she staring at you crowned by the stars and she saw that she was your annihilation. Then out past all things. To lay on the floor and roll your eyes up into your skull. To be fooled by cicadas, to wander the banks of Acheron in a dreadful sleep. To make maps and notes to cause a system of relations that would open the doors past all creation. To make an object out of symbols to usurp all fate and all life itself you could show it to the stars and the legs and flesh and heavens, the trembling heavens, like pale girls in a naked lake, and paint her, as the claws of clouds reaching over your head pull you back into it. Before you dissolve back into empty places where you once lived. Where you will not remember a thing.
