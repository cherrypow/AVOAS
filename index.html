        Black clouds are swallowing themselves. Howls drowned out by the sounds breaking in webs and flooding the heavens. The hot gnash of wind on the trees and skeins of light flickering into your psychosis. You hide beneath a tree. Wild dogs with their jaws dripping with blood slink with their wet coats to the scent of you. You hide in the grips of a swaying tree. Liqour of something still on your breath. Terror horibble, you shutter and scream at nothing. Further and deeper inside your heart there is a birthing of a picture. She comes out of a lake vibrating with the rain and her body is pale and burning and beating is her heart and her eyes black and alien thoughts move like storms behind them. She is dripping and steaming and flickering in the light. Tell them she says to not call her in, to not speak to her. She falls to her knees and takes the knife against her neck and the hot blood like perfume for flowers of flesh to consume and she is burning and you can't forget her. She says paint me please before it's over. The murderous agony of times slow clocking. The vague days burden you with something you seek and you don't know what is. Yet you can't have it. You can't have it. You want it but you can't find it. Dreams. Confound you. And then the rain. Dripping down lampposts, the sound with the window open. The folding breaks of thunder like sonorous shores aspiring to still themselves into silence. The sky closed, covered in her darkness, her liquid hair falling in lobes against his face. Closing his eyes. Scent of salt, and the roots that suck on the mud. 
        Fading from this darker haze: Can't you see me through the storm? Lost colours. My eyes are fireblue. My body is burning hot as campfire. I am watching you.
        Speak memory: Hot tails of fireworks scaling into the dark sky. In a park. Where you bit your tongue and then she looked back, the lobes of firework light like curtains pulsing on her face. Salt taste on your tongue and the pain made your eyes water. And into the woods she took you. The hot mucous on her legs and her eyes staring up at you with a crescent moon in each. And she saw then that she was your annihilation. Then for years you lay on the floor and rolled your eyes up into your skull. Fooled by cicadas, wandering the banks of Acheron in a dreadful sleep. Your maps and your notes you set to cause a system of relations that would allow you to be unchained from all creation. If you could make an object out of symbols in patterns to usurp all fate and all life itself you could show it to the stars and they would bow to you. Paint her. As the claws of clouds reaching over your head pull you back into it. Before you dissolve back empty places where you once lived. Where you will not remember a thing.
